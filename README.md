# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This project provides a visualization of three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. It uses the Pygame library to create a graphical representation of how these algorithms sort a list of elements.

## Features
- Visualization of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort algorithms.
- Option to choose between sorting in ascending or descending order.
- Interactive controls to start sorting, reset the list, and change the sorting order.
- Real-time visualization of the sorting process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
``` https://github.com/sara-totah/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
``` cd sorting-algorithm-visualization ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
``` pip install pygame ```


## Usage
Run the `main.py` file to start the visualization:
python main.py


### Controls
- **R:** Reset the list with new random values.
- **SPACE:** Start sorting.
- **A:** Set sorting order to ascending.
- **D:** Set sorting order to descending.
- **I:** Select Insertion Sort algorithm.
- **B:** Select Bubble Sort algorithm.
- **S:** Select Selection Sort algorithm.

## How it Works
1. Upon running the program, a list of random integers is generated.
2. You can choose the sorting algorithm and the sorting order (ascending or descending).
3. Press the SPACE key to start sorting.
4. The visualization shows the sorting process in real-time.
5. Use the controls to interact with the visualization as described above.

## Code Structure
- `main.py`: Contains the main code for running the visualization and handling user interactions.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guide, and explanation of how the code works.
